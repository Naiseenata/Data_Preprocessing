# Data_Preprocessing
# Objective
The main objective of this data preprocessing project is to clean, preprocess, and transform raw data into a structured, consistent, and meaningful format suitable for machine learning and data analysis. By performing comprehensive data preprocessing, we aim to address common data quality issues, handle missing values, outliers, and appropriately encode categorical variables. This project seeks to enhance the quality, reliability, and usefulness of the data, thereby facilitating more accurate and robust machine learning models and data-driven insights.
# Dataset
The dataset used for this data preprocessing project is called "Dataset for Data preprocessing." The dataset contains information about individuals from various companies, including their age, salary, place, country, and gender.

# Key Components
# 1. Data Exploration
Explored the data to understand its structure and characteristics.
Listed down the unique values in each feature and found its length.
Performed statistical analysis to gain insights into the data distribution.
Renamed the columns for better readability and understanding.
# 2. Data Cleaning
Identified and handled missing and inappropriate values appropriately.
Removed all duplicate rows to ensure data consistency.
Replaced the value 0 in the 'age' column with NaN to represent missing age information.
Treated the null values in all columns using the mean (or other measures if required).
# 3. Data Analysis
Filtered the data with age > 40 and salary < 5000 to extract relevant data points.
Plotted a scatter chart to visualize the relationship between age and salary.
Counted the number of people from each place and represented it visually using a bar chart.
Counted the number of people from each company and represented it visually using a bar chart.
Plotted a histogram of salary to understand its distribution.
Counted the number of males and females in the dataset and represented it visually using bar chart.
# 4. Data Encoding
Converted categorical variables into numerical representations using label encoding for the 'country' column.
Utilized one-hot encoding for other categorical variables to make them suitable for machine learning algorithms.
# 5. Feature Scaling
Performed feature scaling using StandardScaler and MinMaxScaler to bring all features to a similar scale.
Ensured that the scaling was applied to both the training and test data to maintain consistency.
# Results
The data preprocessing process significantly improved the quality and reliability of the dataset, making it suitable for machine learning tasks. The cleaned and encoded data is ready to be used for training and evaluating machine learning models.
